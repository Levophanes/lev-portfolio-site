# First Design Thinking Reflection -- Rowing Rush Problems and Solutions

1: Needfinding

Needfinding was not a difficult process; it is human nature to be annoyed. But for this step, I made the mistake of listing my immediate problems. I should have thought deeper and addressed issues that I could actually solve. For example, I cannot fix Milken's slow Wi-Fi or the "rent-a-cop" at Merman that produces traffic. This step was fun, especially drawing my very precise diagrams, but I need to spend more time on my thinking process for future endeavors. 

2: Defining

3: Ideating

4: Prototyping

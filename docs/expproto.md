### Experience Prototype 1:

Roleplay that you have an urgent appointment in the coming week. Give interviewee access to an app, which shall be drawn on a piece of paper, that shows newly available time slots as a result of cancellations. Have them interact with the app, which will be multiple different pieces of paper, then offer the premium version and repeat the process.

### Experience Prototype 2:

Roleplay that you are going to make an appointment. The person interacts with two people: (1) a very upbeat, happy person who is ready to help them; (2) a monotone, machine-like person who gets the job done and that's it -- no small talk, et cetera. See which they prefer more. Then retry the same prototype but offer an incentive for the less favored option.

# Experience Prototype 3:

Call to inform the interviewee that there has been an opening for an appointment they need. Ask them if they will be able to or want to change their current later appointment date for this new option. First give options for preferable times and then for harder ones.

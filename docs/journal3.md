# Journal 3: POVs and HMWs

# POVs

We met Dr. Reyter, a Russian, Jewish dental surgeon living in Los Angeles.
We were amazed to realize that he thought that a patient could not schedule a doctorâ€™s appointment; that it can only be handled by an office.
It would be game-changing to see if there are other ways to schedule. 

We met Dr. Beigel, a Russian, Jewish dentist from the Soviet Union who is living in Los Angeles.
We were amazed to realize that doctors are booked for months at a time.
It would be game-changing to help work patients into appointments when other people cancel.

We met Rimona, an American college student at UCLA.
We were amazed to realize that she only visits a doctor on necessity.
It would be game-changing to help her build an efficient medical regimen that accommodates her time constraints.

1) How might we take advantage of cancellations?

Idea: Tell interviewees that they have an appointment for an urgent dentist two weeks from now then give them an app (drawn on paper) that shows certain cancellations for their doctor as now available slots. Redo the test with a premium subscription offer to get the ability to take the now available slots first. 

2) How might we make setting up appointments a positive experience? 

Idea: Use incentives and charm to encourage people to set up appointments. 

3) How might we make scheduling appointments feel like talking to a friend?

Idea: Speak on a first-name basis and try to build a friendly ambiance.

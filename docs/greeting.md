# Greetings!

Welcome to the amazing website!

Many years of hard work, dedication, and more dedication led to this moment.

Here are some of my previous projects:

2021 - I created a bot to auto-whitelist myself in NFT servers (yes, I know)

2022 - I coded a discord bot for my friends while I was bored. I eventually put a lot of hours into it and made it pretty fleshed out

2023 - I made a rudimentary stock analysis tool while teaching myself about the basics of Java API
